00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.190
Now let me show you a different
solution to what an action to a button.

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.789
Let's go back to record.

3
00:00:10.572 --> 00:00:14.900
In the description,

4
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.753
our delayed one click property.

5
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.160
And now I'll define the code associated
with a button directly into the Java code.

6
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.590
So here after re-tweeting our
reference to the blue button.

7
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.525
I'll attach un-click listener tweet.

8
00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:46.190
ButtonBlue.setOnClickListener.

9
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.300
So I then I associate an object
with the blue button,

10
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.510
which will listen to the click event.

11
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.040
And when this event occurs,
this object will be called and

12
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.400
this specific method will be called.

13
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.120
So let's say that this, the main activity,
which will in fact listen for the event.

14
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.880
So of course,
main activity is not on click listener,

15
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.375
so we need to make it implement
the on click listener.

16
00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:21.325
I mean that we'll have to
implement the on click method, and

17
00:01:21.325 --> 00:01:25.225
read to generate the skeleton for us.

18
00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:29.945
And now we just need to indicate, what do
we need to do when the button is clicked.

19
00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:33.245
It's with user copy this line here, or

20
00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:39.060
you can directly call to the method,
since it's already reaching.

21
00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:47.027
Okay, now we've attached
an action with the first button,

22
00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:50.070
the blue button, but
not with the pink one.

23
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.348
Let's do that for this button as well.

24
00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.368
Okay and I'll just try it.

25
00:02:05.814 --> 00:02:09.794
When I click on the To Do
on the pink button,

26
00:02:09.794 --> 00:02:13.700
I come to to do, to do, to do pop up.

27
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.150
And when I click on the blue
button it disappears.

28
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.450
Now, I'll show you a different way to
add the button to the graphical user

29
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.090
interface, directly from the JAVA code.
